This project was all about building a easy and effective versatile calculator using python. Users can perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They can also find the area of different shapes such as triangles, rectangles, squares, and circles. The program further allows users to plot polynomial graphs, trigonometric function graphs (like sine, cos, and tan) and even find intersections between linear and quadratic functions. This code also incorporates  error handling for invalid inputs, this calculator/code provides a convenient solution for a wide range of mathematical calculations and graphing tasks.
